= Hazelcast Jet Reference Manual
Version {jet-version}

Welcome to the Hazelcast Jet Reference Manual. This manual includes
concepts, instructions, and samples to guide you on how to use Hazelcast
Jet to build and execute computation jobs.

As the reader of this manual you should be familiar with the Java
programming language.

= Overview

. <<get-started>> leads you through the steps to get Hazelcast Jet up
and running on your machine. You can copy-paste the provided code to
execute your first Jet job.

. <<work-with-jet>> introduces Jet's Pipeline API. This is the API you
use to build the computation you want Jet to execute.

. <<jus>> shows you how you can use Jet's implementation of JDK's
standard `java.util.stream` API to run simple computation jobs.

. <<source-sink-connectors>> presents the source and sink connectors
that Jet provides.

. <<configuration>> explains how to configure Jet. You can tune its
performance, level of safety in fault-tolerant jobs, configure the
underlying IMDG cluster, etc.

. <<data-processing-model>> presents some fundamental concepts that
make Jet work. Understanding these concepts will help you get the most
of Hazelcast Jet.

.  <<expert-zone>> presents low-level details of Jet's execution
engine and the Core API. You don't need this knowledge to use Jet. It is
relevant only if you plan to implement custom processors or build the
DAG by directly using the Core API.
