**At-Least-Once**|.
**Batch Processing**|.
**Client Server Topology**|Hazelcast topology where members run outside the user application, and are connected to clients using client libraries. The client library is installed in the user application.
**DAG**|.
**Edge**|.
**Embedded Topology**|Hazelcast topology where the members are in-process with the user application and act as both client and server.
**Exactly-Once**|.
**Hazelcast Jet Cluster**|A virtual environment formed by Hazelcast members communicating with each other in the cluster.
**Hazelcast Partitions**|Memory segments containing the data. Hazelcast is built-on the partition concept, it uses partitions to store and process data. Each partition can have hundreds or thousands of data entries depending on your memory capacity. You can think of a partition as a block of data. In general and optimally, a partition should have a maximum size of 50-100 Megabytes.
**Hazelcast IMDG**|An in-memory data grid (IMDG) is a data structure that resides entirely in memory, and is distributed among many members in a single location or across multiple locations. IMDGs can support thousands of in-memory data updates per second, and they can be clustered and scaled in ways that support large quantities of data.
**HDFS**|.
**Jet Job**|.
**Member**|A Hazelcast instance. Depending on your Hazelcast usage, it can refer to a server or a Java virtual machine (JVM). Members belong to a Hazelcast cluster. Members are also referred as member nodes, cluster members, or Hazelcast members.
**Processor**|.
**Source**|.
**Sink**|.
**Stream Processing**|.
**Vertex**|.
**Windowing**|.
